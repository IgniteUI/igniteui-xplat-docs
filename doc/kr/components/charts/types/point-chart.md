# {Platform} Point Chart

The {ProductName} Point Chart renders a collection of points. Values are represented on the y-axis (labels on the left side) and categories are displayed on the x-axis (bottom labels). These charts emphasize the amount of change over a period of time or compare multiple items as well as the relationship of parts of a whole by displaying the total of the plotted values.

## {Platform} Point Chart Example

You can create the {Platform} Point Chart in the `CategoryChart` control by binding your data to `ItemsSource` property and setting `ChartType` property to `Point` value, as shown in the example below.

`sample="/charts/category-chart/point-chart-multiple-sources", height="600", alt="{Platform} Point Chart Example"`



<div class="divider--half"></div>

## {Platform} Point Chart with Single Series

In the following example, the {Platform} Point Chart is comparing the generation of renewable electricity for the countries Europe, China, and USA over the years of 2009 to 2019. The Y-Axis, or labels on the left of the chart, are displaying the terawatt hour (TWh) values of renewed electricity and the X-Axis, or labels on the bottom of the chart, are displaying the year.

## {Platform} Point Chart with Multiple Series

Since the {Platform} Point Chart allows you to combine multiple series and compare or see how they change over time, letâ€™s see how easy it is to achieve this. All we need to do is bind to a data source containing the data for China and the USA, and the point chart will automatically update to fit the additional data.

## {Platform} Point Chart Styling

Once the {Platform} Point Chart is set up, we may want to make some further styling customizations such as change the markers and its outlines, brushes and thickness.
