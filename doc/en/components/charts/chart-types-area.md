# $PlatformShort$ Area Chart

$PlatformShort$ Area Chart, or Area Graph, is a type of category area graph that shows a collection of points connected by line segments with the area below the line filled in. The Y-Axis (labels on left side) show a numeric value, while the X-Axis (bottom labels) show a time-series or comparison category. Area Chart emphasizes the amount of change over a period of time or compares multiple items as well as the relationship of parts to a whole by displaying the total of the plotted values. You can include one or more data sets to compare, which would render as multiple areas in the chart.

## $PlatformShort$ Area Chart with Single Series 

The $PlatformShort$ Area Chart is often used to show the change of value over time such as the amount of renewable electricity produced since 2009 over a ten-year period for Europe, as shown in the example below.

<div class="sample-container loading" style="height: 400px">
    <iframe id="cc-chart-with-legend" src='{environment:dvDemosBaseUrl}/charts/category-chart-area-chart-single-source' width="100%" height="100%" seamless frameBorder="0" onload="onXPlatSampleIframeContentLoaded(this);" alt="$PlatformShort$ Line Chart With Legend"></iframe>
</div>

## $PlatformShort$ Area Chart with Multiple Series

Since the $PlatformShort$ Area Chart allows you to combine multiple series and compare or see how they change over time. All we need to do is bind to a data source containing the data for China and the USA, and the area chart will automatically update to fit the additional data.

<div class="sample-container loading" style="height: 400px">
    <iframe id="cc-chart-with-legend" src='{environment:dvDemosBaseUrl}/charts/category-chart-area-chart-multiple-sources' width="100%" height="100%" seamless frameBorder="0" onload="onXPlatSampleIframeContentLoaded(this);" alt="$PlatformShort$ Line Chart With Legend"></iframe>
</div>

## $PlatformShort$ Advanced Area Chart

If you need an Area Chart with more features such as composite other series, you can configure the marker outlines, marker brushes, series brushes, and series outlines as demonstrated below.

<div class="sample-container loading" style="height: 400px">
    <iframe id="cc-chart-with-legend" src='{environment:dvDemosBaseUrl}/charts/category-chart-area-chart-styling' width="100%" height="100%" seamless frameBorder="0" onload="onXPlatSampleIframeContentLoaded(this);" alt="$PlatformShort$ Line Chart With Legend"></iframe>
</div>

## $PlatformShort$ Step Area Chart

The Step Area Chart is similar to a Column Chart with the series filled in.
