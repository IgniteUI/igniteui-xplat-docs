# $PlatformShort$ Shape Chart

This topic explains various types of shape series in the Angular data chart component. Scatter shape series is a group of chart series that take array of shapes (array or arrays of X/Y coordinates) and render them as collection of polygons or polylines in Cartesian (x, y) coordinate system.

Scatter shape series are often used highlight regions in scientific data or they can be used to plot diagrams, blueprints, or even floor plan of buildings.
