# $PlatformShort$ Doughnut Chart

$PlatformShort$ Doughnut Chart is similar to the Pie Chart component, proportionally illustrating the occurrences of a variable. The doughnut chart can display multiple variables in concentric rings, and provides built-in support for visualizing hierarchical data. The rings are capable of being bound to a different data item, or they can share a common data source.

Slice selection and explosion are provided.

<code-view style="height: 400px" 
           data-demos-base-url="{environment:dvDemosBaseUrl}" 
           iframe-src="{environment:dvDemosBaseUrl}/charts/doughnut-chart-rings" 
           alt="$PlatformShort$ Doughnut Multiple Rings" >
