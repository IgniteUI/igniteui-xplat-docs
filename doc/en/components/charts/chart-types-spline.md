# $PlatformShort$ Spline Chart

$PlatformShort$ Spline Chart belongs to a group of Category Series and it is rendered using a collection of points connected by smooth curves of spline.  Values are represented on the y-axis and categories are displayed on the x-axis. Spline Chart emphasizes the amount of change over a period of time or compares multiple items as well as the relationship of parts to a whole by displaying the total of the plotted values. The Spline Chart is identical to the Line Chart in all aspects except that line connecting data points has spline interpolation and smoothing for improved presentation of data.

## $PlatformShort$ Spline Chart with Single Series

The Spline Chart is often used to show the change of value over time such as the amount of renewable electricity produced since 2009 over a ten-year period for Europe, as shown in the example below.

</div>

## $PlatformShort$ Spline Chart with Multiple Series

Since the Spline Chart allows you to combine multiple series and compare or see how they change over time. All we need to do is bind to a data source containing the data for China and the USA, and the chart will automatically update to fit the additional data.

## $PlatformShort$ Stacked Spline Chart

The Stacked Spline Chart is often used to show the change of value over time such as the amount of renewable electricity produced for several years between regions, as we have shown in the example below.
