# $PlatformShort$ Column Charts

$PlatformShort$ Column Charts, Column Graphs, or Vertical Column Charts, are among the most common category chart types used to quickly compare frequency, count, total, or average of data in different categories with data encoded by vertical Columns or equal width and differing lengths. They are ideal for showing variations in the value of an item over time. Data is represented using a collection of rectangles that extend from the left to right of the chart towards the values of data points. The Column Chart is paired with a CategoryXAxis and a NumericYAxis.


<code-view style="height: 400px" 
           data-demos-base-url="{environment:dvDemosBaseUrl}" 
           iframe-src="{environment:dvDemosBaseUrl}/charts/category-chart-column-chart-with-legend" 
           alt="$PlatformShort$ Column Chart with Legend" >
</code-view>

<div class="divider--half"></div>

## $PlatformShort$ Column Chart with Single Series

Column Chart belongs to a group of Category Series and it is rendered using a collection of rectangles that extend from the bottom to top of the chart towards the values of data points.
In this example, the Column Chart uses monthly average temperatures.


<code-view style="height: 400px" 
           data-demos-base-url="{environment:dvDemosBaseUrl}" 
           iframe-src="{environment:dvDemosBaseUrl}/charts/category-chart-column-chart-single-source" 
           alt="$PlatformShort$ Column Chart with Single Source" >
</code-view>

<div class="divider--half"></div>

## $PlatformShort$ Column Chart with Multiple Series

The Column Chart is able to render multiple columns per category for comparison purposes. In this example, the Column Chart is comparing box office revenue amongst popular movie franchises. 


<code-view style="height: 400px" 
           data-demos-base-url="{environment:dvDemosBaseUrl}" 
           iframe-src="{environment:dvDemosBaseUrl}/charts/category-chart-column-chart-multiple-sources" 
           alt="$PlatformShort$ Column Chart with Multiple Sources" >
</code-view>

<div class="divider--half"></div>

## $PlatformShort$ Styling Column Chart

The $PlatformShort$ Column Chart has many options for styling and modification of the visual appearance. For example, the sample below demonstrates using a crossing value for your X-Axis, as well as using marker templates to display the value of an item above (or below) its corresponding column:


<code-view style="height: 400px" 
           data-demos-base-url="{environment:dvDemosBaseUrl}" 
           iframe-src="{environment:dvDemosBaseUrl}/charts/data-chart-column-chart-styling" 
           alt="$PlatformShort$ Column Chart Styling" >
</code-view>

<div class="divider--half"></div>

## $PlatformShort$ Waterfall Chart

Waterfall Chart belongs to a group of category charts and it is rendered using a collection of vertical columns that show the difference between consecutive data points. The columns are color coded for distinguishing between positive and negative changes in value.


<code-view style="height: 400px" 
           data-demos-base-url="{environment:dvDemosBaseUrl}" 
           iframe-src="{environment:dvDemosBaseUrl}/charts/data-chart-waterfall-chart" 
           alt="$PlatformShort$ Waterfall Chart" >
</code-view>

<div class="divider--half"></div>

## $PlatformShort$ Stacked Column Chart

The Stacked Column chart is identical to the Column Chart in all aspects, except the series are represented on top of one another rather than to the side. The Stacked Column Chart is used to show comparing results between series. Renewable electricity produced between USA, Europe and China is demonstrated in the example below.


<code-view style="height: 400px" 
           data-demos-base-url="{environment:dvDemosBaseUrl}" 
           iframe-src="{environment:dvDemosBaseUrl}/charts/data-chart-stacked-column-chart" 
           alt="$PlatformShort$ Stacked Column Chart" >
</code-view>

<div class="divider--half"></div>

## $PlatformShort$ Stacked 100 Column Chart

The Stacked 100 Column Chart is identical to the Stacked Column Chart in all aspects except in their treatment of the values on y-axis. Instead of presenting a direct representation of the data, the Stacked 100 Column presents the data in terms of percent of the sum of all values in a data point. The example below shows a study made for online shopping traffic by departments via tablet, phone and personal computers.


<code-view style="height: 400px" 
           data-demos-base-url="{environment:dvDemosBaseUrl}" 
           iframe-src="{environment:dvDemosBaseUrl}/charts/data-chart-stacked-100-column-chart" 
           alt="$PlatformShort$ Stacked 100 Column Chart" >
</code-view>

<div class="divider--half"></div>

## $PlatformShort$ Range Column Chart

The $ProductName$ range column chart belongs to a group of range charts and is rendered using two lines with the area between the lines filled in. This type of series emphasizes the amount of change between low values and high values in the same data point over a period of time or compares multiple items. Range values are represented on the y-axis and categories are displayed on the X-Axis.

In this Range Column Chart example, weather data variance between high and low temperatures by month is shown.


<code-view style="height: 400px" 
           data-demos-base-url="{environment:dvDemosBaseUrl}" 
           iframe-src="{environment:dvDemosBaseUrl}/charts/data-chart-range-column-chart" 
           alt="$PlatformShort$ Range Column Chart" >
</code-view>

<div class="divider--half"></div>

## $PlatformShort$ Radial Column Chart

The Radial Column Chart belongs to a group of radial charts, and is visualized by using a collection of rectangles that extend from the center of the chart toward the locations of data points. This utilizes the same concepts of data plotting as the Column Chart, but wraps data points around a circle rather than stretching them along a horizontal line.


<code-view style="height: 400px" 
           data-demos-base-url="{environment:dvDemosBaseUrl}" 
           iframe-src="{environment:dvDemosBaseUrl}/charts/data-chart-radial-column-chart" 
           alt="$PlatformShort$ Radial Column Chart" >
</code-view>

<div class="divider--half"></div>
