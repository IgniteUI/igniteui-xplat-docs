# $PlatformShort$ Axis Gridlines

The $ProductName$ chart component includes the built-in capability to modify and configure the gridlines and tickmarks of your axes. This is demonstrated in the examples below.

## Axis Gridlines Example

The major and minor gridlines of the $PlatformShort$ chart can be modified in color, thickness, and frequency by setting the `MajorStroke`, `MinorStroke`, `MajorStrokeThickness`, `MinorStrokeThickness`, `Interval` and `MinorInterval` of the corresponding axis, respectively. In the category chart, the property name will be prefaced by the name of the axis - for example, `YAxisMajorStroke`.

<code-view style="height: 450px" 
           data-demos-base-url="{environment:dvDemosBaseUrl}" 
           iframe-src="{environment:dvDemosBaseUrl}/charts/category-chart-axis-gridlines" 
           alt="$PlatformShort$ Axis Gridlines Example" 
           github-src="charts/category-chart/axis-gridlines">
</code-view>

<div class="divider--half"></div>

## Axis Tickmarks Example

The tickmarks of the X and Y axis in the $PlatformShort$ chart component can be modified in color, thickness, and length by setting the `TickStroke`, `TickStrokeThickness`, and `TickLength` properties of the axis, respectively. In the category chart component, the property name will be prefaced by the name of the axis - for example, `XAxisTickLength`.

<code-view style="height: 450px" 
           data-demos-base-url="{environment:dvDemosBaseUrl}" 
           iframe-src="{environment:dvDemosBaseUrl}/charts/category-chart-axis-tickmarks" 
           alt="$PlatformShort$ Axis Tickmarks Example" 
           github-src="charts/category-chart/axis-tickmarks">
</code-view>

<div class="divider--half"></div>
