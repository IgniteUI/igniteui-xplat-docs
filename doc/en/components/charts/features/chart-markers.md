# $PlatformShort$ Chart Markers

In $ProductName$, markers are visual elements that display the values of data points in the chart's plot area. Markers help your end-users immediately identify a data point's value even if the value falls between major or minor grid lines.

# $PlatformShort$ Chart Marker Example

In the following example, the [Line Chart](../types/line-chart.md) is comparing the generation of renewable electricity for the countries Europe, China, and USA over the years of 2009 to 2019 with markers enabled by setting the `MarkerType` property to "Circle."

The colors of the markers are also managed by setting the `MarkerBrushes` and `MarkerOutlines` properties in the sample below. The markers and `ChartType` is configurable in this sample by using the drop-downs as well.

<code-view style="height: 500px"
           data-demos-base-url="{environment:dvDemosBaseUrl}"
           iframe-src="{environment:dvDemosBaseUrl}/charts/category-chart-marker-options"
           alt="$PlatformShort$ Configuration Options Example"
           github-src="charts/category-chart/marker-options">
</code-view>
