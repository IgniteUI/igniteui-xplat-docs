# {Platform} Chart Animations

Animations allows you to ease-in the series as it loads a new data source. The available animation differs depending on the type of series involved. For example, the column series animates by rising from the x-axis, a line series animates by drawing from the origin of y-axis.

Animations are disabled in the {ProductName} Charts, but they can be enabled by setting the `IsTransitionInEnabled` property to true. From there, you can set the `TransitionInDuration` property to determine how long your animation should take to complete and the `TransitionInMode` to determine the type of animation that takes place.

## {Platform} Chart Animation Example

The following example depicts a [Line Chart](../types/line-chart.md) with an animation set to the default `TransitionInMode` - "Auto." The drop-down and slider at the top in this example will allow you to modify the `TransitionInMode` and `TransitionInDuration`, respectively, so that you can see what the different supported animations look like at different speeds.
