# $PlatformShort$ Financial Chart

$PlatformShort$ Stock Chart, sometimes referred to as $PlatformShort$ Candlestick Chart, is a composite visualization that renders stock ticker data, or price data in an interactive time-series display. Stock ticker represents the company data (a ticker symbol, usually 1 to 5 characters) that you are analyzing. Stock charts show stock prices for a ticker over time in a Time Series X-Axis. Stock charts also show information for a companyâ€™s ticker data like Open Price, High Price, Low Price and Close Price (OHLC) for each time-period. The $PlatformShort$ Stock chart offers multiple ways in which the data can then be visualized and interpreted, including display modes for price and volume and a host of financial indicators. 

The typical stock chart is represented with ticker data in a candlestick chart which is used for the technical analysis of the price ranges. A candlestick chart compares the high and low prices of a day to the open and close of the ticker symbol.

- The body of the candlestick chart shows the open and close trade values (O/C).
- The wicks of the candlestick chart show the high and low trade prices (H/L).
- The distance between the top and bottom of the ticker value is the day range of the ticker price.
- The candlestick chart ticker value is hollow when the asset closed higher than it opened.
- The candlestick chart ticker value is filled when the asset closed lower than it opened.
- A black or red candle represents a price with a lower closing price than the prior candle's close.
- A white or green candle represents a higher closing price than the prior candle's close.

As a Stock Chart is meant to allow the user to perform data analysis functions, it includes interactive elements such as:

- Time-based Filters
- Prices View 
- Volume View
- Indicators View
- Trend Lines
- Navigation / Zoombar View
