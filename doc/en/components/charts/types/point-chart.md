# $PlatformShort$ Point Chart

$PlatformShort$ Point Chart renders a collection of points. Values are represented on the y-axis (labels on the left side) and categories are displayed on the x-axis (bottom labels). These charts emphasize the amount of change over a period of time or compare multiple items as well as the relationship of parts of a whole by displaying the total of the plotted values.

With multiple series, our $PlatformShort$ Point Chart requires more visual indicators for end-users to easily perceive what data is displayed. To improve the experience, we need to add a legend for the multiple series. First, we will add a legend object to our application and then we will set it to the `Legend` property of the $PlatformShort$ `XamCategoryChart`. This gives the benefit for our users to more easily comprehend what data set each point corresponds to.

## $PlatformShort$ Point Chart Example

You can create an Area Chart in the `XamCategoryChart` control by binding your data to `ItemsSource` property and setting `ChartType` property to `Point` value, as shown in the example below.

<code-view style="height: 600px"
           data-demos-base-url="{environment:dvDemosBaseUrl}"
           iframe-src="{environment:dvDemosBaseUrl}/charts/data-chart-point-chart-multiple-sources"
           alt="$PlatformShort$ Point Chart" >
</code-view>

<div class="divider--half"></div>

## $PlatformShort$ Point Chart with Single Series

In the following example, the $PlatformShort$ Point Chart is comparing the generation of renewable electricity for the countries Europe, China, and USA over the years of 2009 to 2019. The Y-Axis, or labels on the left of the chart, are displaying the terawatt hour (TWh) values of renewed electricity and the X-Axis, or labels on the bottom of the chart, are displaying the year.

<code-view style="height: 600px"
           data-demos-base-url="{environment:dvDemosBaseUrl}"
           iframe-src="{environment:dvDemosBaseUrl}/charts/data-chart-point-chart-single-source"
           alt="$PlatformShort$ Point Chart" >
</code-view>

<div class="divider--half"></div>

## $PlatformShort$ Point Chart with Multiple Series

Since the $PlatformShort$ Point Chart allows you to combine multiple series and compare or see how they change over time, letâ€™s see how easy it is to achieve this. All we need to do is bind to a data source containing the data for China and the USA, and the point chart will automatically update to fit the additional data.

<code-view style="height: 600px"
           data-demos-base-url="{environment:dvDemosBaseUrl}"
           iframe-src="{environment:dvDemosBaseUrl}/charts/data-chart-point-chart-multiple-sources"
           alt="$PlatformShort$ Point Chart" >
</code-view>

<div class="divider--half"></div>

## $PlatformShort$ Point Chart Styling

Once our chart is set up, we may want to make some further styling customizations such as change the point colors, change the legend font family, and/or increase the size of the axis labels to make it easier to read.

<code-view style="height: 600px"
           data-demos-base-url="{environment:dvDemosBaseUrl}"
           iframe-src="{environment:dvDemosBaseUrl}/charts/data-chart-point-chart-styling"
           alt="$PlatformShort$ Point Chart" >
</code-view>

<div class="divider--half"></div>
