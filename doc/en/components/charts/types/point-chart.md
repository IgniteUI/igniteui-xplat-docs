# {Platform} Point Chart

The {ProductName} Point Chart renders a collection of points. Values are represented on the y-axis (labels on the left side) and categories are displayed on the x-axis (bottom labels). These charts emphasize the amount of change over a period of time or compare multiple items as well as the relationship of parts of a whole by displaying the total of the plotted values.

## {Platform} Point Chart Example

You can create the {Platform} Point Chart in the `CategoryChart` control by binding your data to `ItemsSource` property and setting `ChartType` property to **Point** enum, as shown in the example below.

<code-view style="height: 600px"
           data-demos-base-url="{environment:dvDemosBaseUrl}"
           iframe-src="{environment:dvDemosBaseUrl}/charts/category-chart-point-chart-multiple-sources"
           github-src="charts/category-chart/point-chart-multiple-sources"
           alt="{Platform} Point Chart Example" >
</code-view>

<div class="divider--half"></div>

## {Platform} Point Chart with Single Series

In the following example, the {Platform} Point Chart plots a single data source by automatically selecting numeric data column for y-axis and non-numeric data column for x-axis.

<code-view style="height: 600px"
           data-demos-base-url="{environment:dvDemosBaseUrl}"
           iframe-src="{environment:dvDemosBaseUrl}/charts/category-chart-point-chart-single-source"
           github-src="charts/category-chart/point-chart-single-source"
           alt="{Platform} Point Chart with Single Series" >
</code-view>

<div class="divider--half"></div>

## {Platform} Point Chart with Multiple Series

Since the {Platform} Point Chart allows you to combine multiple series and compare or see how they change over time, letâ€™s see how easy it is to achieve this. All we need to do is bind to a data source containing the data for China and the USA, and the point chart will automatically update to fit the additional data.

<code-view style="height: 600px"
           data-demos-base-url="{environment:dvDemosBaseUrl}"
           iframe-src="{environment:dvDemosBaseUrl}/charts/category-chart-point-chart-multiple-sources"
           github-src="charts/category-chart/point-chart-multiple-sources"
           alt="{Platform} Point Chart with Multiple Series" >
</code-view>

<div class="divider--half"></div>

## {Platform} Point Chart Styling

Once the {Platform} Point Chart is set up, we may want to make some further styling customizations such as change the markers and its outlines, brushes and thickness.

<code-view style="height: 600px"
           data-demos-base-url="{environment:dvDemosBaseUrl}"
           iframe-src="{environment:dvDemosBaseUrl}/charts/category-chart-point-chart-styling"
           github-src="charts/category-chart/point-chart-styling"
           alt="{Platform} Point Chart Styling" >
</code-view>

<div class="divider--half"></div>
