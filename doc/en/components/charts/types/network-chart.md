# {Platform} Network Chart

The {ProductName} Network Chart, also called Network Graph or Polyline Chart, visualizes complex relationships between a large amount of elements. This visualization displays undirected and directed graph structures. It also shows relationships between entities that are displayed as round nodes and lines show the relationships between them.

The following sections provide examples of various types of Network Charts.

## {Platform} Network Polar Chart

This example demonstrates how to create Network Polar Chart using `PolarScatterSeries` (for rendering node markers) and `PolarLineSeries` (for rendering node connections) in the `XamDataChart` control.

`sample="/charts/data-chart/network-polar-chart", height="600", alt="{Platform} Network Polar Chart"`



<div class="divider--half"></div>

## {Platform} Network Scatter Chart

This example shows how to create Network Scatter Chart using `ScatterSeries` (for rendering node markers) and `ScatterPolylineSeries` (for rendering node connections) in the `XamDataChart` control.

`sample="/charts/data-chart/network-scatter-chart", height="600", alt="{Platform} Network Scatter Chart"`



<div class="divider--half"></div>
