# $PlatformShort$ Bubble Chart

$PlatformShort$ Bubble Chart is a group of series that show markers with variable scaling to represent the relationship among items in several distinct series of data or to plot data items using x and y coordinates. The x and y coordinates of the data point are determined by two numeric data columns. The Bubble Series draw attention to uneven intervals or clusters of data. These types of series are often used to plot scientific data, and can highlight the deviation of collected data from predicted results. Bubble series can also be used to organize data chronologically (even if the data is not in chronological order).

You can create this type of chart in `XamDataChart` control by binding your data to the `BubbleSeries`, as shown in the example below.

<code-view style="height: 600px"
           data-demos-base-url="{environment:dvDemosBaseUrl}"
           iframe-src="{environment:dvDemosBaseUrl}/charts/data-chart-scatter-bubble-chart-multiple-sources"
           alt="$PlatformShort$ Bubble Chart" >

The Bubble Chart contains many of the characteristics of the [Scatter Marker Chart](scatter-chart.md) but with the option to have various radius scale sizes.

<code-view style="height: 600px"
           data-demos-base-url="{environment:dvDemosBaseUrl}"
           iframe-src="{environment:dvDemosBaseUrl}/charts/data-chart-scatter-bubble-chart-single-source"
           alt="$PlatformShort$ Bubble Chart" >
</code-view>

In this example, the Bubble Chart is comparing the total births and deaths between Africa and Europe in 2015.


<code-view style="height: 600px"
           data-demos-base-url="{environment:dvDemosBaseUrl}"
           iframe-src="{environment:dvDemosBaseUrl}/charts/data-chart-scatter-bubble-chart-multiple-sources"
           alt="$PlatformShort$ Bubble Chart" >
</code-view>

<div class="divider--half"></div>
