# {Platform} Pyramid Chart

The {ProductName} Pyramid Chart, also called an age pyramid or population pyramid, is a graphical illustration that shows distribution of various age groups in a population, which forms the shape of a pyramid when the population is growing. It is also used in ecology to determine the overall age distribution of a population; an indication of the reproductive capabilities and likelihood of the continuation of a species.
