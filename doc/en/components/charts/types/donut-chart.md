# $PlatformShort$ Donut Chart

$PlatformShort$ Donut Chart is similar to the Pie Chart component, proportionally illustrating the occurrences of a variable. The donut chart can display multiple variables in concentric rings, and provides built-in support for visualizing hierarchical data. The rings are capable of being bound to a different data item, or they can share a common data source.


## $PlatformShort$ Donut Chart Example

<code-view style="height: 600px"
           data-demos-base-url="{environment:dvDemosBaseUrl}"
           iframe-src="{environment:dvDemosBaseUrl}/charts/doughnut-chart-legend"
           alt="$PlatformShort$ Doughnut Legend" >
</code-view>

<div class="divider--half"></div>

## $PlatformShort$ Donut Chart - Slice Selection

The $PlatformShort$ Donut Chart has the ability to select slices on click, as demonstrated by the below sample:


<code-view style="height: 600px"
           data-demos-base-url="{environment:dvDemosBaseUrl}"
           iframe-src="{environment:dvDemosBaseUrl}/charts/doughnut-chart-selection"
           alt="$PlatformShort$ Donut Slice Selection" >
</code-view>

<div class="divider--half"></div>

<!-- ## $PlatformShort$ Donut Chart - Slice Explosion

The $PlatformShort$ Donut Chart has the ability to explode its slices outward from the continuous ring of the chart on click, as demonstrated by the below sample:


<code-view style="height: 600px"
           data-demos-base-url="{environment:dvDemosBaseUrl}"
           iframe-src="{environment:dvDemosBaseUrl}/charts/doughnut-chart-explosion"
           alt="$PlatformShort$ Doughnut Slice Explosion" >
</code-view>

<div class="divider--half"></div> -->

## $PlatformShort$ Donut Chart - Multiple Rings

It is possible to have a multiple ring display in the $PlatformShort$ Donut Chart, with each of the rings capable of being bound to a different data item, or they can share a common data source. This can be helpful if you need to display your data as tiers that have an underlying common category, such as the season to month data display below:


<code-view style="height: 600px"
           data-demos-base-url="{environment:dvDemosBaseUrl}"
           iframe-src="{environment:dvDemosBaseUrl}/charts/doughnut-chart-rings"
           alt="$PlatformShort$ Doughnut Multiple Rings" >
</code-view>

<div class="divider--half"></div>
