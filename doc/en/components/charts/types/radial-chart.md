# $PlatformShort$ Radial Chart

Radial Chart is a group of series that takes data and render it as collection of data points wrapped around a circle (rather than stretching along a horizontal line as Category Series do). Just like Category Series, Radial Chart are also mapping a list of categories from the minimum to the maximum of the extent of the chart, and support the same category grouping mechanisms of Category Series.

## $PlatformShort$ Radial Chart Styling

Once our radial chart is created, we may want to make some further styling customizations such as a change of the line colors, marker types, or outline colors of those markers.


<code-view style="height: 400px"
           data-demos-base-url="{environment:dvDemosBaseUrl}"
           iframe-src="{environment:dvDemosBaseUrl}/charts/data-chart-radial-area-chart-styling"
           alt="$PlatformShort$ Radial Area Chart Styling" >
</code-view>
