# $PlatformShort$ Step Chart

$PlatformShort$ Step Chart belongs to a group of Category Series and it is rendered using a collection of points connected by continuous vertical and horizontal lines. For Step Area Chart, the area below lines are filled in. Values are represented on the y-axis and categories are displayed on the x-axis. This emphasizes the amount of change over a period of time or compares multiple items.
