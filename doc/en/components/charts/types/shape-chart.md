# $PlatformShort$ Shape Chart

This topic explains various types of shape series in the Angular data chart component. Scatter shape series is a group of chart series that take array of shapes (array or arrays of X/Y coordinates) and render them as collection of polygons or polylines in Cartesian (x, y) coordinate system.

Scatter shape series are often used highlight regions in scientific data or they can be used to plot diagrams, blueprints, or even floor plan of buildings.

## $PlatformShort$ Scatter Polygon Chart

The Scatter Polygon Chart belongs to a group of shape charts that take an array of shapes represented by an array or array of arrays of X/Y coordinates. This series renders that array or array of arrays as a collection of polygons in the Cartesian (x, y) coordinate system. These samples can be used to plot diagrams, blueprints, or even the floor plan of buildings.
