# Ignite UI CLI for {Platform}

Our CLI tools provide project templates pre-configured for the {ProductName} toolset that help you get your next application off the ground in record time. The <!-- React --> <a href="https://github.com/IgniteUI/igniteui-cli/blob/master/README.md#generate-ignite-ui-for-react-project" target="_blank"><!-- end: React --><!-- WebComponents --><a href="https://github.com/IgniteUI/igniteui-cli/blob/master/README.md#generate-ignite-ui-for-web-components-project" target="_blank"><!-- end: WebComponents -->Ignite UI CLI</a> is a stand-alone command-line tool for creating and scaffolding your applications for a variety of different frameworks and provides a substantial productivity boost for developers.

## Getting Started

To get started, install the CLI:

```cmd
npm install -g igniteui-cli
```

The above install command will make the Ignite UI CLI available for creation, scaffolding, and running of your {ProductName} application.

## Create a New Project

To create an application that is configured to use the {ProductName} controls using the Ignite UI CLI, you can use the following template in your command line:

<!-- React -->
```cmd
ig new "[name_of_project]" --framework=[target_framework] --type=[project_type]
```

Using the above template, if you wanted to create a **React** application named "My Project" targeting ES6, you could write the following command:

```cmd
ig new "My Project" --framework=react --type=igr-es6
```
<!-- end: React -->

<!-- WebComponents -->
```cmd
ig new "[name_of_project]" --framework=[target_framework]
```

Using the above template, if you wanted to create a **Web Components** application named "My Project" you could write the following command:

```cmd
ig new "My Project" --framework=webcomponents
```
<!-- end: WebComponents -->

## Adding Components

Once you have created a project, you can then add additional component templates using **ig add** at any point. Running this command without any parameters will guide you through the available templates by using a keyboard navigation CLI to add the control of your choosing.

```cmd
ig add
```

Alternatively, you can simply run the **ig list** command to get a full list of supported templates in the current project you have created.

```cmd
ig list
```

After running **ig list** and you find the component template you would like to add, you can do so quickly by following this template in your command line:

```cmd
ig add [component_template] [component_name]
```

The "component_template" above will generally match an {ProductName} component ("grid", "category-chart", "linear-gauge", etc.).

For example, if you wanted to add a data grid templated component named "MyGridComponent" to your application, you could run the following:

```cmd
ig add grid MyGridComponent
```

<!-- WebComponents -->
Currently the CLI can be used with the following Web Components:

| Name | Component Template |
| ------------------|---------------------|
| Avatar | avatar  |
| Card | card |
| Badge | badge |
| Button | button |
| Checkbox | checkbox |
| Form | form |
| Icon | icon |
| Icon Button | icon-button |
| Input | input |
| Radio Group | radio-group |
| Switch | switch |
| Calendar | calendar |
| List | list |
| Navbar | navbar |
| Ripple | ripple |
| Pie Chart | pie-chart |
| Dock Manager | dock-manager |
<!-- end: WebComponents -->

## Build and Run the Application

In order to build and run the {ProductName} application, you can call the **ig build** and **ig run** commands:

```cmd
ig build
ig run
```
