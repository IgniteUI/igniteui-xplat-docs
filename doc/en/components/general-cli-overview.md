# Ignite UI CLI for {Platform}

Our CLI tools provide project templates pre-configured for the {ProductName} toolset that help you get your next application off the ground in record time. The <!-- React --> <a href="https://github.com/IgniteUI/igniteui-cli/blob/master/README.md#generate-ignite-ui-for-react-project" target="_blank"><!-- end: React --><!-- WebComponents --><a href="https://github.com/IgniteUI/igniteui-cli/blob/master/README.md#generate-ignite-ui-for-web-components-project" target="_blank"><!-- end: WebComponents -->Ignite UI CLI</a> is a stand-alone command-line tool for creating and scaffolding your applications for a variety of different frameworks and provides a substantial productivity boost for developers.

## Getting Started

To get started, install the CLI:

```cmd
npm install -g igniteui-cli
```

The above install command will make the Ignite UI CLI available for creation, scaffolding, and running of your {ProductName} application.

## Create a New Project

To create an application that is configured to use the {ProductName} controls using the Ignite UI CLI, you can use the following template in your command line:

<!-- React -->
```cmd
ig new "[name_of_project]" --framework=[target_framework] --type=[project_type]
```

Using the above template, if you wanted to create a **React** application named "My Project" targeting TypeScript, you could write the following command:

```cmd
ig new "My Project" --framework=react --type=igr-ts
```

> [!Note]
TypeScript support will be available starting from Ignite UI CLI version 13.

<!-- end: React -->

<!-- WebComponents -->
```cmd
ig new "[name_of_project]" --framework=[target_framework]
```

Using the above template, if you wanted to create a **Web Components** application named "My Project" you could write the following command:

```cmd
ig new "My Project" --framework=webcomponents
```
<!-- end: WebComponents -->

## Adding Components

Once you have created a project, you can then add additional component templates using **ig add** at any point. Running this command without any parameters will guide you through the available templates by using a keyboard navigation CLI to add the control of your choosing.

```cmd
ig add
```

Alternatively, you can simply run the **ig list** command to get a full list of supported templates in the current project you have created.

```cmd
ig list
```

After running **ig list** and you find the component template you would like to add, you can do so quickly by following this template in your command line:

```cmd
ig add [component_template] [component_name]
```

The "component_template" above will generally match an {ProductName} component ("grid", "category-chart", "linear-gauge", etc.).

For example, if you wanted to add a data grid templated component named "MyGridComponent" to your application, you could run the following:

```cmd
ig add grid MyGridComponent
```

> NOTE: Your routing file will be updated with the path to the page with the new component - in that case `/my-grid-component`. You can use it to manually navigate to the newly generated page.

<!-- WebComponents -->
Currently the CLI can be used with the following Web Components:

| Name | Component Template |
| ------------------|---------------------|
| Avatar | avatar  |
| Card | card |
| Badge | badge |
| Button | button |
| Checkbox | checkbox |
| Form | form |
| Icon | icon |
| Icon Button | icon-button |
| Input | input |
| Radio Group | radio-group |
| Switch | switch |
| Calendar | calendar |
| List | list |
| Navbar | navbar |
| Ripple | ripple |
| Pie Chart | pie-chart |
| Dock Manager | dock-manager |
<!-- end: WebComponents -->

## Build and Run the Application

In order to build and run the {ProductName} application, you can call the **ig build** and **ig run** commands:

```cmd
ig build
ig run
```
<!-- React -->
### Using Vite

The React application generated by Ignite UI CLI utilizes Vite as the build tool. Vite offers fast development and production builds, providing an efficient development experience with features like hot module replacement (HMR) during development.
