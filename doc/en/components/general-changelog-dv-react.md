# {ProductName} Changelog

All notable changes for each version of {ProductName} are documented on this page.

## **{PackageVerChanges-23-1}**

### New Components

* [Toolbar](menus/toolbar.md) - Beta. This component is a companion container for UI operations to be used primarily with our charting components. The toolbar will dynamically update with a preset of properties and tool items when linked to our `XamDataChart` or `CategoryChart` components. You'll be able to create custom tools for your project allowing end users to provide changes, offering an endless amount of customization.

### {PackageCharts} Charts

* [ValueLayer](charts/features/chart-overlays.md#{PlatformLower}-value-layer) - A new series type named the `ValueLayer` is now exposed which can allow you to render an overlay for different focal points of the plotted data such as Maximum, Minimum, and Average. This is applied to the `CategoryChart` and `FinancialChart` by adding to the new `ValueLines` collection.

* It is now possible to apply a **dash array** to the different parts of the series of the `XamDataChart`. You can apply this to the [series](charts/types/line-chart.md#{PlatformLower}-styling-line-chart) plotted in the chart, the [gridlines](charts/features/chart-axis-gridlines.md#{PlatformLower}-axis-gridlines-properties) of the chart, and the [trendlines](charts/features/chart-trendlines.md#{PlatformLower}-chart-trendlines-dash-array-example) of the series plotted in the chart.

## **{PackageVerChanges-22-2}**

Added significant improvements to default behaviors, and refined the Category Chart API to make it easier to use.

These new chart improvements include:

* Responsive layouts for horizontal label rotation based on browser / screen size.
* Enhanced rendering for rounded labels on all platforms.
* Added marker properties to StackedFragmentSeries.
* Added `ShouldPanOnMaximumZoom` property.
* New Category Axis Properties:
    - ZoomMaximumCategoryRange
    - ZoomMaximumItemSpan
    - ZoomToCategoryRange
    - ZoomToItemSpan
* New [Chart Aggregation](charts/features/chart-data-aggregations.md) API for Grouping, Sorting and Summarizing Category string and numeric values, eliminating the need to pre-aggregate or calculate chart data:
  - InitialSortDescriptions
  - InitialSorts
  - SortDescriptions
  - InitialGroups
  - InitialGroupDescriptions
  - GroupDescriptions
  - InitialSummaries
  - InitialSummaryDescriptions
  - SummaryDescriptions
  - InitialGroupSortDescriptions
  - GroupSorts
  - GroupSortDescriptions

> [!Note]
[Chart Aggregation](charts/features/chart-data-aggregations.md) will not work when using `IncludedProperties` | `ExcludedProperties`. These properties on the chart are meant for non-aggregated data. Once you attempt to aggregate data these properties should no longer be used. The reason it does not work is because aggregation replaces the collection that is passed to the chart for render.  The include/exclude properties are designed to filter in/out properties of that data and those properties no longer exist in the new aggregated collection.

### {PackageGrids} (Data Grid)

* Changed `Column` to `DataGridColumn`
* Changed `GridCellEventArgs` to `DataGridCellEventArgs`
* Changed `GridSelectionMode` to `DataGridSelectionMode`
* Changed `SummaryOperand` to `DataSourceSummaryOperand`

## **{PackageVerChanges-22-1}**
### {PackageCharts} (Charts)

* Added the highly-configurable [DataLegend](charts/features/chart-data-legend.md) component, which works much like the `Legend`, but it shows values of series and provides many configuration properties for filtering series rows and values columns, styling and formatting values.
* Added the highly-configurable [DataToolTip](charts/features/chart-data-tooltip.md) which displays values and titles of series as well as legend badges of series in a tooltip. This is now the default tooltip for all chart types.
* Added animation and transition-in support for Stacked Series. Animations can be enabled by setting the `IsTransitionInEnabled` property to true. From there, you can set the `TransitionInDuration` property to determine how long your animation should take to complete and the `TransitionInMode` to determine the type of animation that takes place.
* Added `AssigningCategoryStyle` event, is now available to all series in `DataChart`. This event is handled when you want to conditionally configure aspects of the series items such as `Fill` background-color and highlighting.
* New `AllowedPositions` enumeration for CalloutLayer. Used to limit where the callouts are to be placed within the chart. By default, the callouts are intelligently placed in the best place but this used to force for example `TopLeft`, `TopRight`, `BottomLeft` or `BottomRight`.
* New corner radius properties added for Annotation Layers; used to round-out the corners of each of the callouts. Note, a corner radius has now been added by default.
    - `CalloutCornerRadius` for CalloutLayer
    - `AxisAnnotationBackgroundCornerRadius` for FinalValueLayer
    - `XAxisAnnotationBackgroundCornerRadius` and `YAxisAnnotationBackgroundCornerRadius` for CrosshairLayer
* New `HorizontalViewScrollbarMode` and `VerticalViewScrollbarMode` enumeration to enable scrollbars in various ways. When paired with `IsVerticalZoomEnabled` or `IsHorizontalZoomEnabled`, you'll be able to persist or fade-in and out the scrollbars along the axes to navigate the chart.
* New `FavorLabellingScaleEnd`, determines whether the axis should favor emitting a label at the end of the scale. Only compatible with numeric axes (e.g. `NumericXAxis`, `NumericYAxis`, `PercentChangeAxis`).
* New `IsSplineShapePartOfRange` determines whether to include the spline shape in the axis range requested of the axis.
* New `XAxisMaximumGap`, determines the maximum allowed value for the plotted series when using `XAxisGap`. The gap determines the amount of space between columns or bars of plotted series.
* New `XAxisMinimumGapSize`, determines the minimum allowed pixel-based value for the plotted series when using `XAxisGap` to ensure there is always some spacing between each category.

### {PackageGrids} (Data Grid)

* New Feature Added:
- [Row Paging](grids/data-grid/row-paging.md)

Pagination is used to split a large set of data into a sequence of pages that have similar content. With pagination, data can be displayed in a set number of rows, letting users “scroll” through their data, without needing a scroll bar. The UI for table pagination usually includes things like the current page, total pages, and clickable Previous and Next arrows/buttons that let users flip through the pages of data.

## **{PackageVerChanges-21-2.1}**

### {PackageGrids} (Data Grid)

- Changed `ValueField` property from type string[] to string.

### {PackageInputs} (Inputs)

#### Date Picker
- Changed ValueChanged event to `SelectedValueChanged`.

#### Multi-Column ComboBox

- Changed `ValueChanged` event to `SelectedValueChanged`.

<div class="divider--half"></div>

## **{PackageVerChanges-21-2}**

> [!Note]
> Please ensure package "lit-html": "^2.0.0" or newer is added to your project for optimal compatibility.

### {PackageCharts} (Charts)

This release introduces a few improvements and simplifications to visual design and configuration options for the geographic map and all chart components.

* Changed `YAxisLabelLocation` property's type to **YAxisLabelLocation** from **AxisLabelLocation** in `FinancialChart` and `CategoryChart`
* Changed `XAxisLabelLocation` property's type to **XAxisLabelLocation** from **AxisLabelLocation** in `FinancialChart`

## **{PackageVerChanges-21-1}**
### {PackageCharts} (Charts)

This release introduces several new and improved visual design and configuration options for all of the chart components, e.g. `DataChart`, `CategoryChart`, and `FinancialChart`.

* Changed Bar/Column/Waterfall series to have square corners instead of rounded corners
* Changed Scatter High Density series’ colors for heat min property from <span style="color:#8a5bb1">#8a5bb1</span> to <span style="color:#000000">#000000</span>
* Changed Scatter High Density series’ colors for heat max property from <span style="color:#ee5879">#ee5879</span> to <span style="color:#ee5879">#ee5879</span>
* Changed Financial/Waterfall series’ `NegativeBrush` and `NegativeOutline` properties from <span style="color:#C62828">#C62828</span> to <span style="color:#ee5879">#ee5879</span>
* Changed marker's thickness to 2px from 1px
* Changed marker's fill to match the marker's outline for `PointSeries`, `BubbleSeries`, `ScatterSeries`, `PolarScatterSeries`. You can use set `MarkerFillMode` property to Normal to undo this change
* Compressed labelling for the `TimeXAxis` and `OrdinalTimeXAxis`
* New Marker Properties:
    - series.`MarkerFillMode` - Can be set to `MatchMarkerOutline` so the marker depends on the outline
    - series.`MarkerFillOpacity` - Can be set to a value 0 to 1
    - series.`MarkerOutlineMode` - Can be set to `MatchMarkerBrush` so the marker's outline depends on the fill brush color
* New Series Property:
    - series.`OutlineMode` - Can be set to toggle the series outline visibility. Note, for Data Chart, the property is on the series
* New chart properties that define bleed over area introduced into the viewport when the chart is at the default zoom level. A common use case is to provide space between the axes and first/last data points. Note, the `ComputedPlotAreaMarginMode`, listed below, will automatically set the margin when markers are enabled. The others are designed to specify a `Double` to represent the thickness, where PlotAreaMarginLeft etc. adjusts the space to all four sides of the chart:
    - chart.`PlotAreaMarginLeft`
    - chart.`PlotAreaMarginTop`
    - chart.`PlotAreaMarginRight`
    - chart.`PlotAreaMarginBottom`
    - chart.`ComputedPlotAreaMarginMode`
* New Highlighting Properties
    - chart.`HighlightingMode` - Sets whether hovered or non-hovered series to fade, brighten
    - chart.`HighlightingBehavior` - Sets whether the series highlights depending on mouse position e.g. directly over or nearest item
    - Note, in previous releases the highlighting was limited to fade on hover.
* Added Highlighting Stacked, Scatter, Polar, Radial, and Shape series:
* Added Annotation layers to Stacked, Scatter, Polar, Radial, and Shape series:
* Added support for overriding the data source of individual stack fragments within a stacked series
* Added custom style events to Stacked, Scatter, Range, Polar, Radial, and Shape series
* Added support to automatically sync the vertical zoom to the series content
* Added support to automatically expanding the horizontal margins of the chart based on the initial labels displayed
* Redesigned color palette of series and markers:

| Old brushes/outlines | New outline/brushes |
| -------------------- | ------------------- |
| <span style="color:#7446B9">#7446B9</span> <br><span style="color:#9FB328">#9FB328</span> <br><span style="color:#F96232">#F96232</span> <br><span style="color:#2E9CA6">#2E9CA6</span> <br><span style="color:#DC3F76">#DC3F76</span> <br><span style="color:#FF9800">#FF9800</span> <br><span style="color:#3F51B5">#3F51B5</span> <br><span style="color:#439C47">#439C47</span> <br><span style="color:#795548">#795548</span> <br><span style="color:#9A9A9A">#9A9A9A</span> | <span style="color:#8bdc5c">#8bdc5c</span> <br><span style="color:#8b5bb1">#8b5bb1</span> <br><span style="color:#6db1ff">#6db1ff</span> <br><span style="color:#f8a15f">#f8a15f</span> <br><span style="color:#ee5879">#ee5879</span> <br><span style="color:#735656">#735656</span> <br><span style="color:#f7d262">#f7d262</span> <br><span style="color:#8ce7d9">#8ce7d9</span> <br><span style="color:#e051a9">#e051a9</span> <br><span style="color:#a8a8b7">#a8a8b7</span> <br> |

## **{PackageVerChangedFields}**

### {PackageGrids} (Data Grid)

> [!Note]
> These breaking changes were introduce in the grid package.

- Changed name of PropertyPath

The data grid component property `propertyPath` has been renamed to `field`. This applies to all Column types, GroupDescription, SortDescription & SummaryDescription.

```tsx
 <IgrTextColumn field="Name"/>
```

```ts
import { IgrColumnSummaryDescription, IgrColumnSortDescription, IgrColumnGroupDescription } from 'igniteui-react-grids'
const productCount = new IgrColumnSummaryDescription();
productCount.field = "ProductName";
const colSortDesc = new IgrColumnSortDescription();
colSortDesc.field = "UnitsInStock";
const income = new IgrColumnGroupDescription();
income.field = "Income";
```

## **{PackageVerRenamedGrid}**

### {PackageGrids} (Data Grid)

- Changed Name of Live Grid

The data grid component and it's corresponding module's names have changed from "LiveGrid" to "DataGrid".

> [!Note]
> These breaking changes were introduce in these packages and components only:

The new code for importing the grid and it's corresponding module is:

```ts
import { IgrDataGrid } from "igniteui-react-grids";
import { IgrDataGridModule } from 'igniteui-react-grids';
```

- Required Peer Dependency for Data Grid

The data grid component requires the "inputs" package.

```ts
**npm install --save {PackageInputs}**
```

<div class="divider--half"></div>

## **{PackageVerChangedImports}**

- Changed Import Statements

Import statements have been simplified to use just package names instead of full paths to API classes and enums.

> [!Note]
> These breaking changes were introduce in these packages and components only:

| <a href="{PackageWebsite}{PackageGrids}/v/{PackageVerChangedImports}" target="_blank">{PackageGrids}</a> | [Data Grid](grids/data-grid/overview.md) |

- Code After Changes

Now, you need to use just package names instead of full paths to API classes and enums.

Please also note that the name of the Data Grid component and its corresponding modules have also changed.

```ts
// gauges:
import { IgrLinearGauge } from "igniteui-react-gauges";
import { IgrLinearGaugeModule } from "igniteui-react-gauges";
import { IgrLinearGraphRange } from "igniteui-react-gauges";
import { IgrRadialGauge } from 'igniteui-react-gauges';
import { IgrRadialGaugeModule } from 'igniteui-react-gauges';
import { IgrRadialGaugeRange } from 'igniteui-react-gauges';
import { SweepDirection } from 'igniteui-react-core';
// charts:
import { IgrFinancialChart } from 'igniteui-react-charts';
import { IgrFinancialChartModule } from 'igniteui-react-charts';
import { IgrDataChart } from 'igniteui-react-charts';
import { IgrDataChartCoreModule } from 'igniteui-react-charts';
// maps:
import { IgrGeographicMap } from "igniteui-react-maps";
import { IgrGeographicMapModule } from "igniteui-react-maps";
// grids:
import { IgrLiveGrid } from "igniteui-react-grids";
import { IgrLiveGridModule } from 'igniteui-react-grids';
```

- Code Before Changes

Before, you had to import using full paths to API classes and enums:

```ts
