# Themes in $ProductName$

$ProductName$ ships with four distinct themes - Bootstrap, Material, Fluent, and Indigo. All component themes are baked into the components, however, a global style file is required for palettes, typography, and other global configurations to work.

## Loading a Theme

To enable a theme, a theme file should be loaded. Depending on your project configuration you can either `import` or `link`.

Here's the complete list of all bundled themes and their path:

| Name        | Variant | Location                                          |
| ----------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Bootstrap   | Light   | igniteui-webcomponents/themes/light/bootstrap.css |
| Material    | Light   | igniteui-webcomponents/themes/light/material.css  |
| Fluent      | Light   | igniteui-webcomponents/themes/light/fluent.css    |
| Indigo      | Light   | igniteui-webcomponents/themes/light/indigo.css    |
| Bootstrap   | Dark    | igniteui-webcomponents/themes/dark/bootstrap.css  |
| Material    | Dark    | igniteui-webcomponents/themes/dark/material.css   |
| Fluent      | Dark    | igniteui-webcomponents/themes/dark/fluent.css     |
| Indigo      | Dark    | igniteui-webcomponents/themes/dark/indigo.css     |


## Runtime Theme Switching

> [!NOTE]
Changing the theme at runtime also requires you to replace the global stylesheet from the table above.

$ProductName$ allows you to switch the component themes at runtime by using the `ConfigureTheme` function exported by the library.

Calling it and passing one of the four valid themes - bootstrap, material, fluent, or indigo as a string will change the loaded component styles;

```ts
import { configureTheme } from "igniteui-webcomponents";

// Sets material as the theme to be used by all components
configureTheme("material");
```
