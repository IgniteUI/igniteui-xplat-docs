# {Platform} Chat Overview

The {ProductName} Chat component provides a complete solution for building conversational interfaces in your applications. Whether you are creating a customer support tool, a collaborative workspace, or a chatbot assistant, the Chat component gives you the building blocks you need: sending and receiving text messages, uploading file attachments, displaying quick reply suggestions, showing typing indicators when the other participant is writing a response.

Unlike a static message list, the `Chat` component is interactive and designed for **real-time communication**. It manages input, rendering, and user interaction while giving you full control over how messages and attachments are displayed. It also exposes an extensive rendering API that lets you override any part of its layout or visuals.

## Installation
<!-- WebComponents -->

To get started, install the {ProductName} by running the following command:

```cmd
npm install {PackageWebComponents}
```

Once installed, you can import the component in your project and register it so it becomes available as a custom element:

```ts
import { defineComponents, IgcChatComponent } from "igniteui-webcomponents";
import 'igniteui-webcomponents/themes/light/bootstrap.css';

defineComponents(IgcChatComponent);
```
The CSS file includes one of our default themes. You can replace it with a different theme or create a custom one if you want the `Chat` to match your application‚Äôs branding.

## Usage
The simplest way to use the `Chat` is to declare it in your HTML:
```ts
const options: IgcChatOptions = {
  currentUserId: 'me',
  headerText: 'Support Chat',
};
```
```html
<igc-chat id="myChat" .options=${options}>
</igc-chat>
```

Here, the `current-user-id` attribute tells the component which messages are ‚Äúoutgoing‚Äù (sent by the current user) versus ‚Äúincoming‚Äù (sent by others). The `header-text` provides a title for the chat window.

Once rendered, you can programmatically add messages:
```ts
const chat = document.getElementById('myChat');
chat.addMessage({
  id: '1',
  userId: 'me',
  content: 'Hello! How can I help you?',
  timestamp: new Date()
});
```
This approach makes it easy to plug the Chat into your own data source, such as a server endpoint, a chatbot engine, or a collaborative app backend.

### Properties
The `Chat` component exposes several key properties that let you control its state and configuration:

| Name              | Description                                                                                                                                                          |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `messages`        | Array of messages (`IgcChatMessage[]`) displayed in the chat. You can bind to this to control which messages are shown.                                                  |
| `draftMessage`    | The current unsent message, represented as an object containing `text` and optional `attachments`. This is useful for saving or restoring message drafts.            |
| `options`         | Chat configuration (`IgcChatOptions`) such as current user ID, input placeholders, accepted file types, quick reply suggestions, typing delay, and custom renderers. |
| `resourceStrings` | Localized resource strings for labels, headers, and system text. Use this property to adapt the component for different languages.                                   |

These properties make it straightforward to synchronize the Chat‚Äôs UI with your application‚Äôs state and backend.

### Attachments
Modern conversations are rarely limited to text alone. The Chat component includes built-in support for file attachments, allowing users to share images, documents, and other files.
By default, the input area includes an attachment button. You can control which file types are allowed by setting the `acceptedFiles` property:

```ts
const options: IgcChatOptions = {
  acceptedFiles="image/*,.pdf",
};
```
In this example, users will only be able to upload images and PDF files.
If your use case does not require attachments, you can easily turn them off:
```ts
const options: IgcChatOptions = {
  disableInputAttachments: true,
};
```
### Suggestions
Quick reply suggestions provide users with pre-defined responses they can tap to reply instantly. This feature is particularly useful in chatbots, customer service flows, or when guiding users through a structured process.
You can provide suggestions by binding an array of strings to the suggestions property. The `suggestions-position` attribute lets you control where they are displayed: either below the input area or below the messages list.
```ts
const options: IgcChatOptions = {
  currentUserId: "me",
  suggestions: ['Yes', 'No', 'Maybe later'],
  suggestionsPosition: 'below-input'
};
```
```html
<igc-chat
  .options=${options}>
</igc-chat>
```
This approach helps streamline user interactions by reducing the need to type repetitive answers and improves the overall experience in guided conversations.

### Typing Indicator
Conversations feel more natural when participants can see that the other person is typing. The Chat component provides this behavior through the `isTyping` property of the options object.
When set to true, the chat shows a subtle typing indicator below the messages:
```ts
const options: IgcChatOptions = {
  isTyping: true
};
```
This feature is typically toggled programmatically, for example when receiving a typing event from your backend service.

### Custom Renderers
While the Chat component works out of the box with its default UI, many applications need to customize the look and feel. For example, you might want to add read receipts, display avatars, or replace the input area with a voice recording button.
The `Chat` component addresses this need with a renderer system. A renderer is simply a function that returns a template for a given part of the UI. You can override as many or as few renderers as you like.

#### ChatTemplateRenderer
Every renderer follows the same function signature:
```ts
export type ChatTemplateRenderer<T> = (ctx: T) => unknown;
```

The ctx parameter provides different contextual data depending on what is being rendered.
#### Renderer Contexts
| Context Type                | Provided Data                                                                                                          |
| --------------------------- | -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `ChatRenderContext`       | `instance` (the chat component instance).                                                                              |
| `ChatInputRenderContext`      | Inherits `ChatRenderContext` and adds `attachments` (array of `ChatMessageAttachment`) and `value` (current input text). |
| `ChatMessageRenderContext`    | Inherits `ChatRenderContext` and adds `ChatMessage` (the `ChatMessage` being rendered).                                      |
| `ChatAttachmentRenderContext` | Inherits `ChatMessageRenderContext` and adds `attachment` (the `ChatMessageAttachment` being rendered).                      |

#### Available Renderers
The following parts of the Chat can be customized:
- Message-level: message, messageHeader, messageContent, messageAttachments, messageActions
- Attachment-level: attachment, attachmentHeader, attachmentContent
- Input-level: input, inputActions, inputAttachments, fileUploadButton, sendButton
- Suggestions: suggestionPrefix
- Miscellaneous: typingIndicator

This level of granularity means you can tweak just one part (for example, how attachments look) without rewriting the entire chat layout.

#### Example: Custom Message Content
This example shows how to replace the message bubble with your own template:
```ts
const options = {
  renderers = {
    messageContent: (ctx) => {
      const { message } = ctx;
      return html`<div class="bubble custom">${message.content}</div>`;
    }
  }
};
```

#### Example: Custom Input Area
By default, the chat input is a text area. You can override it to provide a more tailored experience, such as adding a voice input button:
```ts
const options = {
  renderers = {
    input: (ctx) => html`
      <textarea placeholder=${ctx.instance?.options?.inputPlaceholder || 'Type here...'}>${ctx.value}</textarea>
      <button @click=${() => alert('Voice input!')}>üé§</button>
    `
  }
};
```

### Markdown Rendering
The Chat component includes built-in support for Markdown content through the `createMarkdownRenderer` helper, which is exported from the `igniteui-webcomponents/extras` entry point of the main package. This allows you to display messages with formatted text, links, lists, and even syntax-highlighted code blocks, while ensuring that all rendered HTML is sanitized for security.

> [!Note]
> To use the Markdown renderer, you need to install the following peer dependencies in your project:
```cmd
npm install marked marked-shiki shiki dompurify
```
By default, messages are rendered as plain text. If you want to enable Markdown support, you can override the messageContent renderer and use the Markdown renderer as shown below:
```ts
import { createMarkdownRenderer } from 'igniteui-webcomponents/extras';

// Create a reusable Markdown renderer instance
const markdownRenderer = await createMarkdownRenderer();

const options = {
  renderers: {
    messageContent: async ({ message }) => markdownRenderer(message),
  }
};
```
In this example:
- Each message‚Äôs text property will be parsed as Markdown using the [marked](https://github.com/markedjs/marked) library.
- The renderer sanitizes the output using [DOMPurify](https://github.com/cure53/DOMPurify)
- Links automatically open in a new tab with safe rel attributes.

#### Syntax Highlighting

The Markdown renderer also supports syntax highlighting for code blocks using [Shiki](https://shiki.matsu.io/). By default, it includes highlighting for JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML, and CSS with the github-light theme. You can customize this behavior through MarkdownRendererOptions:
```ts
const markdownRenderer = await createMarkdownRenderer({
  theme: { light: 'min-light' },
  languages: ['javascript', 'python']
});
```
This will enable highlighted code blocks for JavaScript, Python, and Go, styled with the GitHub dark theme.
#### Configuration Options
| Option          | Description                                                                     |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `noHighlighter` | If `true`, disables syntax highlighting entirely.                               |
| `languages`     | List of programming languages to support in highlighted code blocks.            |
| `theme`         | An object specifying Shiki themes to apply. Supports separate values for `light` and `dark` mode (e.g., `{ light: 'github-light', dark: 'github-dark' }`). |
| `sanitizer`     | A custom function to sanitize the final HTML. Defaults to `DOMPurify.sanitize`. |

### Events
To integrate with your application logic, the Chat component emits a set of events:
- igcMessageCreated ‚Äì when a new message is created.
- igcMessageReact ‚Äì when a message is reacted to.
- igcAttachmentClick ‚Äì when an attachment is clicked.
- igcAttachmentChange ‚Äì when an attachment changes.
- igcAttachmentDrag ‚Äì while dragging an attachment.
- igcAttachmentDrop ‚Äì when an attachment is dropped.
- igcTypingChange ‚Äì when typing status changes.
- igcInputFocus / igcInputBlur ‚Äì input focus events.
- igcInputChange ‚Äì when the input value changes.

You can listen for these events and sync them with your backend:
```ts
chat.addEventListener('IgcMessageCreated', (e) => {
  console.log('Message:', e.detail);
});
```
<!-- end: WebComponents -->

  padding: 0.5rem;
}

igc-chat::part(empty-state) {
  font-style: italic;
  color: var(--ig-gray-500);
}
```

This allows you to style the Chat to match your brand without replacing its functionality.
