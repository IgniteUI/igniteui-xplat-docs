# {ProductName} Changelog

All notable changes for each version of {ProductName} are documented on this page.

## **{PackageVerChanges-24-1-JUN}**

### General
- `Input`, `Textarea` - exposed `ValidateOnly` to enable validation rules being enforced without restricting user input.
- `Dropdown` - `PositionStrategy` property is deprecated. The dropdown now uses the `Popover` API to render its container in the top layer of the browser viewport, making the property obsolete.
- `DockManager` - `SplitPane` `IsMaximized` is deprecated. Having isMaximized set to true on a split pane level has no real effect as split panes serve as containers only, meaning they have no actual content to be shown maximized. Use the `IsMaximized` property of `TabGroupPane` and/or `ContentPane` instead.

### {PackageGrids}
- `DisplayDensity` deprecated in favor of the `--ig-size` CSS custom property.
- `PivotGrid` - The type of Columns, Rows, Filters from `PivotConfiguration` option is now array of IgbPivotDimension - `IgbPivotDimension[]`, it was `IgbPivotDimensionCollection` previously.

The type of Values from `PivotConfiguration` option is now array of IgbPivotValue - `IgbPivotValue[]`, it was `IgbPivotValueCollection` previously.

### {PackageCharts} (Charts)

* [Data Legend Grouping](charts/features/chart-data-legend.md#{PlatformLower}-data-legend-grouping) & [Data Tooltip Grouping](charts/features/chart-data-tooltip.md#{PlatformLower}-data-tooltip-grouping-for-data-chart) - New grouping feature added. The property `GroupRowVisible` toggles grouping with each series opting in can assign group text via the `DataLegendGroup` property. If the same value is applied to more than one series then they will appear grouped. Useful for large datasets that need to be categorized and organized for all users.

- [Chart Selection](charts/features/chart-data-selection.md) - New series selection styling. This is adopted broadly across all category, financial and radial series for `CategoryChart` and `XamDataChart`. Series can be clicked and shown a different color, brightened or faded, and focus outlines. Manage which items are effected through individual series or entire data item. Multiple series and markers are supported. Useful for illustrating various differences or similarities between values of a partcular dataitem. Also  `SelectedSeriesItemsChanged` event and `SelectedSeriesItems` are available for additional help to build out robust business requirements surrouding other actions that can take place within an application such as a popup or other screen with data analysis based on the selection.  

- [Proportional Category Angle Axis](../types/radial-chart.md) - New axes for the Radial Pie Series in the `XamDataChart`, to enable creating pie charts in the allowing robust visualizations using all the added power of the data chart.

- [Treemap Highlighting](charts/types/treemap-chart.md#{PlatformLower}-treemap-highlighting) - Now exposes a `HighlightingMode` property that allows you to configure the mouse-over highlighting of the items in the tree map. This property takes two options: `Brighten` where the highlight will apply to the item that you hover the mouse over only, and `FadeOthers` where the highlight of the hovered item will remain the same, but everything else will fade out. This highlight is animated, and can be controlled using the `HighlightingTransitionDuration` property.
    
- [Treemap Percent-based Highlighting](charts/types/treemap-chart.md#{PlatformLower}-treemap-percent-based-highlighting) - New percent-based highlighting, allowing nodes to represent progress or subset of a collection. The appearance is shown as a fill-in of its backcolor up to a specific value either by a member on your data item or by supplying a new `HighlightedItemsSource`. Can be toggled via `HighlightedValuesDisplayMode` and styled via `FillBrushes`.

- `Toolbar` - New `IsHighlighted` option for ToolAction for outlining a border around specific tools of choice.

### {PackageGauges} (Gauges)

- `XamRadialGauge`
    - New label for the highlight needle. `HighlightLabelText` and `HighlightLabelSnapsToNeedlePivot` and many other styling related properties for the HighlightLabel were added.

## **{PackageVerChanges-23-2-APR2}**

### {PackageCharts} (Charts)

Data Filtering via the `InitialFilter` property. Apply filter expressions to filter the chart data to a subset of records. Can be used for drill down large data.

- `XamBulletGraph`
    - The Performance bar will now reflect a difference between the value and new `HighlightValue` when the `HighlightValueDisplayMode` is applied to the 'Overlay' setting. The highlight value will show a filtered/subset measured percentage as a filled in color while the remaining bar's appearance will appear faded to the assigned value, illustrating the performance in real-time.
- `XamLinearGauge`
    - New highlight needle was added. `HighlightValue` and `HighlightValueDisplayMode` when both are provided a value and 'Overlay' setting, this will make the main needle to appear faded and a new needle will appear. 
- `XamRadialGauge`
    - New highlight needle was added. `HighlightValue` and `HighlightValueDisplayMode` when both are provided a value and 'Overlay' setting, this will make the main needle to appear faded and a new needle will appear.

## **{PackageVerChanges-23-2-APR}**

- `Bug Fixes` 

## **{PackageVerChanges-23-2-MAR}**

### New Components

- [`HierarchicalGrid`](grids/hierarchical-grid/overview.md) component
- `Textarea` component
- `ButtonGroup` component

### New Features

- `DockManager`
    - New `ProximityDock` property. If enabled, docking indicators are not visible and the end user can dock the dragged pane by dragging it close to the target pane edges.
    - New `ContainedInBoundaries` property. Determines whether the floating panes are kept inside the Dock Manager boundaries. Defaults to `false`.
    - New `ShowPaneHeaders` property. Determines whether pane headers are only shown on hover or always visible. Defaults to `always`.
- `Tree`
    - Added `toggleNodeOnClick` property that determines whether clicking over a node will change its expanded state or not. Defaults to `false`.
- `Rating`
    - `allowReset` added. When enabled selecting the same value will reset the component. **Behavioral change** - In previous releases this was the default behavior of the rating component. Make sure to set `allowReset` if you need to keep this behavior in your application.
- `Select`, `Dropdown` 
    - exposed `selectedItem`, `items` and `groups` getters
- `XamRadialGauge`
    - New title/subtitle properties. `TitleText`, `SubtitleText` will appear near the bottom the gauge. In addition, the various title/subtitle font properties were added such as `TitleFontSize`, `TitleFontFamily`, `TitleFontStyle`, `TitleFontWeight` and `TitleExtent`. Finally, the new `TitleDisplaysValue` will allow the value to correspond with the needle's position.  
    - New `OpticalScalingEnabled` and `OpticalScalingSize` properties for the `XamRadialGauge`. This new feature will manage the size at which labels, titles, and subtitles of the gauge have 100% optical scaling. You can read more about this new feature [here](radial-gauge.md#optical-scaling)
    - New highlight needle was added. `HighlightValue` and `HighlightValueDisplayMode` when both are provided a value and 'Overlay' setting, this will make the main needle to appear faded and a new needle will appear.  
- `XamRadialChart` 
    - New Label Mode
        The `CategoryAngleAxis` for the now exposes a `LabelMode` property that allows you to further configure the location of the labels. This allows you to toggle between the default mode by selecting the `Center` enum, or use the new mode, `ClosestPoint`, which will bring the labels closer to the circular plot area.

### General

- `Input`, `MaskInput`, `DateTimeInput`, `Rating`
	- `Readonly` has been renamed to `ReadOnly`
- `Input`
	- `Maxlength` has been renamed to `MaxLength`
	- `Minlength` has been renamed to `MinLength`

### Deprecations

- The `size` property and attribute have been deprecated for all components. Use the `--ig-size` CSS custom property instead. The following example sets the size of the avatar component to small:
    ```css
    .avatar {
        --ig-size: var(--ig-size-small);
    }
    ```
- `DateTimeInput`
    - `MinValue` and `MaxValue` properties have been deprecated. Please, use `Min` and `Max` instead.
- `RangeSlider`
    - `AriaLabelLower` and `AriaLabelUpper` properties have been deprecated. Please, use `ThumbLabelLower` and `ThumbLabelUpper` instead.

### Removed

- Removed our own `dir` attribute which shadowed the default one. This is a non-breaking change.
- `Slider` - `ariaLabel` shadowed property. This is a non-breaking change.
- `Checkbox` - `ariaLabelledBy` shadowed attribute. This is a non-breaking change.
- `Switch` - `ariaLabelledBy` shadowed attribute. This is a non-breaking change.
- `Radio` - `ariaLabelledBy` shadowed attribute. This is a non-breaking change.

## **{PackageVerChanges-23-2-JAN}**

### .NET 8.0 support

* 2023.2 release now support .NET 8. For more information on .NET 8 please refer to [this article on Microsoft's site](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/whats-new/dotnet-8) .

### {PackageCharts} (Charts)

* [Chart Highlight Filter](charts/features/chart-highlight-filter.md) - The `CategoryChart` and `XamDataChart` now expose a way to highlight and animate in and out of a subset of data. The display of this highlight depends on the series type. For column and area series, the subset will be shown on top of the total set of data where the subset will be colored by the actual brush of the series, and the total set will have a reduced opacity. For line series, the subset will be shown as a dotted line.

## **{PackageVerChanges-23-2}**

### {PackageGrids} (Toolbar - Beta)

* Save tool action has been added to save the chart to an image via the clipboard.
* Vertical orientation has been added via the toolbar's `Orientation` property. By default the toolbar is horizontal, now the toolbar can be shown in vertical orientation where the tools will popup to the left/right respectfully. 
* Custom SVG icons support was added via the toolbar's `renderImageFromText` method, further enhancing custom tool creation.

### {PackageGrids} (Grid)

* Added New Features - [State Persistence](grids/grid/state-persistence.md)

## **{PackageVerChanges-23-1}**

### New Components

* [Toolbar](menus/toolbar.md) - Beta. This component is a companion container for UI operations to be used primarily with our charting components. The toolbar will dynamically update with a preset of properties and tools when linked to our `XamDataChart` or `CategoryChart` components, but it also gives you the ability to create custom tools for your project.

### {PackageCharts} (Charts)

* [ValueLayer](charts/features/chart-overlays.md#{PlatformLower}-value-layer) - A new series type named the `ValueLayer` is now exposed which can allow you to render an overlay for different focal points of the plotted data such as Maximum, Minimum, and Average. This is applied to the `CategoryChart` and `FinancialChart` by adding to the new `ValueLines` collection.

* It is now possible to apply a **dash array** to the different parts of the series of the `XamDataChart`. You can apply this to the [series](charts/types/line-chart.md#{PlatformLower}-styling-line-chart) plotted in the chart, the [gridlines](charts/features/chart-axis-gridlines.md#{PlatformLower}-axis-gridlines-properties) of the chart, and the [trendlines](charts/features/chart-trendlines.md#{PlatformLower}-chart-trendlines-dash-array-example) of the series plotted in the chart.

## **{PackageVerChanges-22-2.65}**
### New Components

* [Stepper](layouts/stepper.md)

### New Components

* [Dialog](notifications/dialog.md)
* [Select](inputs/select.md)

### {PackageGrids} (Data Grid)

* A new argument `PrimaryKey` has been introduced to `IgbRowDataEventArgs` from `Detail`, and part of the event arguments that are emitted by the `RowAdded` and `RowDeleted` events. When the grid has a primary key attribute added, then the emitted primaryKey event argument represents the row ID, otherwise it defaults to null.
* `RowSelectionChanging` event arguments are changed. Now, the `OldSelection`, `NewSelection`, `Added` and `Removed` collections no longer consist of the row keys of the selected elements when the grid has set a primaryKey, but now in any case the row data is emitted.
* When the grid is working with remote data and a primary key has been set, the selected rows that are not currently part of the grid view will be emitted for a partial row data object.
* When selected row is deleted from the grid component `RowSelectionChanging` event will no longer be emitted.
* The `OnGroupingDone` event has been renamed to `GroupingDone` to not violate the no on-prefixed outputs convention.
* The `OnDensityChanged` event has been renamed to `DensityChanged` to not violate the no on-prefixed outputs convention. All components exposing this event are affected.

### {PackageGrids} (Pivot Grid)

* The `IgbPivotDateDimension` properties `InBaseDimension` and `InOption` have been deprecated and renamed to `BaseDimension` and `Options` respectively.

### {PackageInputs} (Inputs)

* `IgbDateTimeInput`, the StepDownAsync(DateTimeInputDatePart.Date, SpinDelta.Date) is now trimmed down to DatePart instead of DateTimeInputDatePart
* `IgbRadio` and `IgbRadioGroup`, added component validation along with styles for invalid state
* `IgbMask`, added the capability to escape mask pattern literals.
* `IgbBadge` added a `Shape` property that controls the shape of the badge and can be either `Square` or `Rounded`. The default shape of the badge is rounded.
* `IgbAvatar`, the `RoundShape` property has been deprecated and will be removed in a future version. Users can control the shape of the avatar by the newly added `Shape` attribute that can be `Square`, `Rounded` or `Circle`. The default shape of the avatar is `Square`.

### {PackageDockManager} (DockManager)

* [Dock Manager's](layouts/dock-manager.md) Panes collection now has a protected setter; requires you to call Add rather than set panes in a nested structure when creating them.

## **{PackageVerChanges-22-2.50}**

### New Components

* [Combo](inputs/combo/overview.md)
* [Pivot Grid](grids/pivot-grid/overview.md)
* .NET 7.0

## **{PackageVerChanges-22-2}**

### New Components

* [Grid](grids/data-grid.md)
* [TreeGrid](grids/tree-grid/overview.md)

### {PackageCharts} (Charts)

Added significant improvements to default behaviors, and refined the Category Chart API to make it easier to use. These new chart improvements include:

* Responsive layouts for horizontal label rotation based on browser / screen size.
* Enhanced rendering for rounded labels on all platforms.
* Added marker properties to StackedFragmentSeries.
* Added `ShouldPanOnMaximumZoom` property.
* New Category Axis Properties:
    - ZoomMaximumCategoryRange
    - ZoomMaximumItemSpan
    - ZoomToCategoryRange
    - ZoomToItemSpan
* New [Chart Aggregation](charts/features/chart-data-aggregations.md) API for Grouping, Sorting and Summarizing Category string and numeric values, eliminating the need to pre-aggregate or calculate chart data:
  - InitialSortDescriptions
  - InitialSorts
  - SortDescriptions
  - InitialGroups
  - InitialGroupDescriptions
  - GroupDescriptions
  - InitialSummaries
  - InitialSummaryDescriptions
  - SummaryDescriptions
  - InitialGroupSortDescriptions
  - GroupSorts
  - GroupSortDescriptions

> [!Note]
[Chart Aggregation](charts/features/chart-data-aggregations.md) will not work when using `IncludedProperties` | `ExcludedProperties`. These properties on the chart are meant for non-aggregated data. Once you attempt to aggregate data these properties should no longer be used. The reason it does not work is because aggregation replaces the collection that is passed to the chart for render.  The include/exclude properties are designed to filter in/out properties of that data and those properties no longer exist in the new aggregated collection.

### {PackageGrids} (Data Grid)

* Changed **{IgPrefix}Column** to `DataGridColumn`
* Changed **GridCellEventArgs** to `DataGridCellEventArgs`
* Changed **GridSelectionMode** to `DataGridSelectionMode`
* Changed **SummaryOperand** to `DataSourceSummaryOperand`

## **{PackageVerChanges-22-1}**

### {PackageCharts} (Charts)

* Added the highly-configurable [DataLegend](charts/features/chart-data-legend.md) component, which works much like the `Legend`, but it shows values of series and provides many configuration properties for filtering series rows and values columns, styling and formatting values.
* Added the highly-configurable [DataToolTip](charts/features/chart-data-tooltip.md) which displays values and titles of series as well as legend badges of series in a tooltip. This is now the default tooltip for all chart types.
* Added animation and transition-in support for Stacked Series. Animations can be enabled by setting the `IsTransitionInEnabled` property to true. From there, you can set the `TransitionInDuration` property to determine how long your animation should take to complete and the `TransitionInMode` to determine the type of animation that takes place.
* Added `AssigningCategoryStyle` event, is now available to all series in `XamDataChart`. This event is handled when you want to conditionally configure aspects of the series items such as `Fill` background-color and highlighting.
* New `AllowedPositions` enumeration for CalloutLayer. Used to limit where the callouts are to be placed within the chart. By default, the callouts are intelligently placed in the best place but this used to force for example `TopLeft`, `TopRight`, `BottomLeft` or `BottomRight`.
* New corner radius properties added for Annotation Layers; used to round-out the corners of each of the callouts. Note, a corner radius has now been added by default.
    - `CalloutCornerRadius` for CalloutLayer
    - `AxisAnnotationBackgroundCornerRadius` for FinalValueLayer
    - `XAxisAnnotationBackgroundCornerRadius` and `YAxisAnnotationBackgroundCornerRadius` for CrosshairLayer
* New `HorizontalViewScrollbarMode` and `VerticalViewScrollbarMode` enumeration to enable scrollbars in various ways. When paired with `IsVerticalZoomEnabled` or `IsHorizontalZoomEnabled`, you'll be able to persist or fade-in and out the scrollbars along the axes to navigate the chart.
* New `FavorLabellingScaleEnd`, determines whether the axis should favor emitting a label at the end of the scale. Only compatible with numeric axes (e.g. `NumericXAxis`, `NumericYAxis`, `PercentChangeAxis`).
* New `IsSplineShapePartOfRange` determines whether to include the spline shape in the axis range requested of the axis.
* New `XAxisMaximumGap`, determines the maximum allowed value for the plotted series when using `XAxisGap`. The gap determines the amount of space between columns or bars of plotted series.
* New `XAxisMinimumGapSize`, determines the minimum allowed pixel-based value for the plotted series when using `XAxisGap` to ensure there is always some spacing between each category.

### {PackageGrids} (Data Grid)

Added New Feature - [Row Paging](grids/data-grid/row-paging.md) which is used to split a large set of data into a sequence of pages that have similar content. With pagination, data can be displayed in a set number of rows, letting users “scroll” through their data, without needing a scroll bar. The UI for table pagination usually includes things like the current page, total pages, and clickable Previous and Next arrows/buttons that let users flip through the pages of data.

### {PackageDockManager} (Dock Manager)

* The {Platform} Dock Manager is now in "Preview" state, that provides a way to manage a complex layout using different type of panes with various sizes, positions, and behaviors, and that can be docked to various locations within an app. The [Dock Manager](layouts/dock-manager.md) allows your end-users to customize it further by pinning, resizing, moving, floating, and hiding panes.

### New Components

* [Chip](inputs/chip.md)
* [Circular Progress](inputs/circular-progress.md)
* [Linear Progress](inputs/linear-progress.md)
* [Drop Down](inputs/dropdown.md)
* [Slider & Range Slider](inputs/slider.md)
* [Snackbar](notifications/snackbar.md)
* [Toast](notifications/toast.md)

## **{PackageVerChanges-21-2.1}**

> [!Note]
> The following breaking changes were introduced

### {PackageGrids} (Data Grid)

- Changed `ValueField` property from type string[] to string.

### {PackageInputs} (Inputs)

- A new `ValueChanged` event supports 2-way binding and should only be handled if you have not bound the `Value` property. In order to read the Value field from the control without databinding the `ValueChanged` event should be handled, otherwise if your data is not bound you should use GetCurrentValueAsync to read the controls Value.

#### Date Picker
- Changed `ValueChanged` event to `SelectedValueChanged`.

#### Multi-Column ComboBox
- Changed `TextChanged` event to `TextValueChanged`.
- Changed `ValueChanged` event to `SelectedValueChanged`.

## **{PackageVerChanges-21-2}**

> [!Note]
> The **Igb** prefix is now required for the {ProductName} components and nested elements within each component. This API change was necessary to avoid ambiguity between Infragistics controls and 3rd party controls.
>
> For example, ``` <IgbCategoryChart/> ``` instead of ``` <CategoryChart/> ```

### New Components

* [Avatar](layouts/avatar.md)
* [Badge](inputs/badge.md)

## **{PackageVerChanges-21-1}**
### New Visual Designs

#### Charts & Maps

This release introduces several new and improved visual design and configuration options for all of the chart components, e.g. `XamDataChart`, `CategoryChart`, and `FinancialChart`.

* Changed Bar/Column/Waterfall series to have square corners instead of rounded corners
* Changed Scatter High Density series’ colors for heat min property from <span style="color:#8a5bb1">#8a5bb1</span> to <span style="color:#000000">#000000</span>
* Changed Scatter High Density series’ colors for heat max property from <span style="color:#ee5879">#ee5879</span> to <span style="color:#ee5879">#ee5879</span>
* Changed Financial/Waterfall series’ `NegativeBrush` and `NegativeOutline` properties from <span style="color:#C62828">#C62828</span> to <span style="color:#ee5879">#ee5879</span>
* Changed marker's thickness to 2px from 1px
* Changed marker's fill to match the marker's outline for `PointSeries`, `BubbleSeries`, `ScatterSeries`, `PolarScatterSeries`. You can use set `MarkerFillMode` property to Normal to undo this change
* Compressed labelling for the `TimeXAxis` and `OrdinalTimeXAxis`
* New Marker Properties:
    - series.`MarkerFillMode` - Can be set to `MatchMarkerOutline` so the marker depends on the outline
    - series.`MarkerFillOpacity` - Can be set to a value 0 to 1
    - series.`MarkerOutlineMode` - Can be set to `MatchMarkerBrush` so the marker's outline depends on the fill brush color
* New Series Property:
    - series.`OutlineMode` - Can be set to toggle the series outline visibility. Note, for Data Chart, the property is on the series
* New chart properties that define bleed over area introduced into the viewport when the chart is at the default zoom level. A common use case is to provide space between the axes and first/last data points. Note, the `ComputedPlotAreaMarginMode`, listed below, will automatically set the margin when markers are enabled. The others are designed to specify a `Double` to represent the thickness, where PlotAreaMarginLeft etc. adjusts the space to all four sides of the chart:
    - chart.`PlotAreaMarginLeft`
    - chart.`PlotAreaMarginTop`
    - chart.`PlotAreaMarginRight`
    - chart.`PlotAreaMarginBottom`
    - chart.`ComputedPlotAreaMarginMode`
* New Highlighting Properties
    - chart.`HighlightingMode` - Sets whether hovered or non-hovered series to fade, brighten
    - chart.`HighlightingBehavior` - Sets whether the series highlights depending on mouse position e.g. directly over or nearest item
    - Note, in previous releases the highlighting was limited to fade on hover.
* Added Highlighting Stacked, Scatter, Polar, Radial, and Shape series:
* Added Annotation layers to Stacked, Scatter, Polar, Radial, and Shape series:
* Added support for overriding the data source of individual stack fragments within a stacked series
* Added custom style events to Stacked, Scatter, Range, Polar, Radial, and Shape series
* Added support to automatically sync the vertical zoom to the series content
* Added support to automatically expanding the horizontal margins of the chart based on the initial labels displayed
* Redesigned color palette of series and markers:
