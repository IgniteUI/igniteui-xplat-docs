# {Platform} Grid Cell Activation

The {ProductName} Data Table / Data Grid supports a cell activation feature that will enable keyboard navigation through the cells of the grid. This is activated by setting the `ActivationMode` property of the grid to `Cell`.

## {Platform} Grid Cell Activation Example


`sample="/grids/data-grid/cell-activation", height="600", alt="{Platform} Grid Cell Activation Example"`



<div class="divider--half"></div>

## Excel Style Navigation

`EnterBehaviorAfterEdit` property will configure the grid to navigate to the next cell up, down, left or right after the enter key is pressed in edit mode. Otherwise, the `EnterBehavior` property of the grid can be used to navigate to other cells, while not in edit mode, up, down, left or right.

## Keyboard Navigation

After setting the `ActivationMode` property of the grid to `Cell`, this will enable a range of keyboard navigation options in the data grid. Below is a description of each of the key presses / combinations and the effect they will have relative to the currently activated cell:

- <kbd>↑</kbd>: Navigate one cell up.
- <kbd>↓</kbd>: Navigate one cell down.
- <kbd>←</kbd>: Navigate one cell to the left on the current row only.
- <kbd>→</kbd>: Navigate one cell to the right on the current row only.
- <kbd>PAGE UP</kbd>: Scroll the grid one viewport page up.
- <kbd>PAGE DOWN</kbd>: Scroll the grid one viewport page down.
- <kbd>TAB</kbd>: Move the active cell to the next cell to the right, or the left-most cell of the next row if the last cell of that row is reached.
- <kbd>SHIFT</kbd> + <kbd>TAB</kbd>: Move the active cell to the next cell to the left, or the right-most cell of the previous row if the first cell of that row is reached.
- <kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>↑</kbd>: Move to the top cell in the column.
- <kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>↓</kbd>: Move to the bottom cell in the column.
- <kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>←</kbd>: Move to the left-most cell in the row.
- <kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>→</kbd>: Move to the right-most cell in the row.
- <kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>HOME</kbd>: Move to the top-left cell in the grid.
- <kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>END</kbd>: Move to the bottom-right cell in the grid.
